# twitter-hate-speech-detection

### Project Description

The motivation for this project is to build a reliable pipeline that can identify and protect twitter users from hateful speech. To achieve this goal, we will experiment with various tweet vectorization techniques and evaluate performance on a logistic regression model, a random forest model, and a neural network.
